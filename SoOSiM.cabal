Name:                SoOSiM
Version:             0.1
Synopsis:            Abstract full system simulator

Description:
  SoOSiM is a simulator developed for the purpose of exploring operating
  system concepts and operating system modules. The simulator provides a
  highly abstracted view of a computing system, consisting of computing
  nodes, and components that are concurrently executed on these nodes.
  OS modules are subsequently modelled as components that progress as a
  result of reacting to two types of events: messages from other components,
  or a system-wide tick event. Using this abstract view, a developer can
  quickly formalize assertions regarding the interaction between operating
  system modules and applications.
